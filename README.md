### What I learned

This is my first time doing DOM manipulation and javascript, i learned so many things such as using Javascript to manipulate the text content of an element, to change the css properties, I also learrned a little bit about how the functions work in Javascript. This is by far the most satifying project I did on html/css/javascript :>>
